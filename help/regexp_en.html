<h1>Regular expressions</h1>
<p>Ant Renamer uses the TRegExpr library. You can find a <a onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;"
  href="http://www.regexpstudio.com/TRegExpr/Help/RegExp_Syntax.html">syntax reference on the site dedicated to this library</a>. These expressions
  are quite complex but also quite "standard", so I won't make here a detailed guide explaining how they work.</p>
<p>For the "Regular expression" action, you have to provide two values:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Expression, containing a valid regular expression;</li>
  <li>New name, containing the new name of the file, with $<i>nn</i> backreferences (<i>nn</i> being a number) to indicate where found strings
  have to be inserted. Note: these backreferences are presented with "\" instead of "$" on the syntax page mentionned above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of non-alphanumeric characters have a special meaning in regular expressions. To use them, the escape character is the backslash ("\").
  This also applies to the "$" sign that has a special meaning in the "new name" field. If you need to use the backslash as a character (e.g. as
  path delimiter in the new name) you have to double it ("\\").</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Swapping artist and title from mp3 file names:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Expression = <code>(.*) - (.*)\.mp3</code></li>
  <li>New name = <code>$2 - $1.mp3</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Extract episode number and title from series video files with episode number as S<i>nn</i>E<i>mm</i> followed by title:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Expression = <code>Code\.Quantum\.S([0-9]{2})E([0-9]{2})\.(.*)\.FRENCH.XViD\.avi</code></li>
  <li>New name = <code>Code Quantum - $1$2 - $3.avi</code></li>
</ul>
