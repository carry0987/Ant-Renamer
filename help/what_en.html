<h1>What the program does...</h1>
<p>This program is designed to rename files. So it will only touch the files' names, it will not modify their contents.</p>
<p>It was made for renaming, but in the <a href="options_en.html">Options</a> you can ask it to copy the files instead of renaming them.</p>
<p>It can <a href="batch_en.html">store a predefined list of actions</a> to reuse them later.
<p>It supports unicode, which means that you can rename files that have characters in Greek, Japanese, Chinese, Arab or any other language. Since most of the
  programs have problems with such names, it can be useful to be able to rename them to Latin (basic ASCII) characters for example.</p>
<h1>... and what it does not</h1>
<p>As I said, it won't modify the contents of the files.</p>
<p>It will not either modify files' date & time.</p>
<p>It will not modify the ID3 (tag) contained in MP3s; it only read this info for building a new file name.</p>
<p>It does not read any info from files other than MP3s, and even for MP3s it only reads the v1 of the ID3, not the v2.</p>
<p>It cannot be fully controlled from command line, though it supports some <a href="params_en.html">parameters</a>.</p>
<p>Note that the contents of this list is not fixed. Except modifying the contents of the files, all the "does not" things may appear in future versions.</p>
<h2>Known bugs and limitations:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Unicode is supported only on NT systems (Windows NT4, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8.x).</li>
  <li>Batch files cannot have unicode characters in their name and path.</li>
  <li>Ditto for the folder where the program is located, and for the command-line when it is called with parameters.</li>
  <li>Since version 2.04 the program does not start on some Windows 95 versions, it seems to be caused by a missing Unicode function on these system.</li>
  <li>In the "Use date &amp; time" action, if you use a long date format (with day or month in letters, like "December" in English), it will fail for days
    or months that have special characters in their name (like "Décembre" in French). This bug will be corrected soon, but I have to find how to do that.</li>
</ul>
