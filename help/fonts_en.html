<h1>Font used for special characters</h1>
<p>In the <a href="options_en.html">options window</a> you can select which font has to be used in fields that have to display special characters. This option
  is only available under NT systems (NT4, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8.x) since Unicode is not supported on Windows 95, 98 or ME.</p>
<p>If you only use basic latin characters, you can select any font (e.g. "MS Sans Serif" which is the default for American &amp; West-European systems).
  But if special or foreign character are not displayed correctly (e.g. you see squares instead of the characters), you may need to select a different font.</p>
<p>By default, the program tries to use "Arial Unicode MS". This font comes with Microsoft Office but is not included in default install.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I cannot distribute this font. It is the most complete font that I know, so if you have Microsoft Office I recommend to install this font
  (it is called "Universal font" in the installation options).</p>
<p>There was also a font called "Bitstream Cyberbit" that had lots of characters, but it is not available anymore from Bitstream's site.</p>
<p>If you do not have one of these two fonts, you can try to use Arial, Verdana or Tahoma that are included with Windows. But they do not include lots of characters.</p>
<p>If you have more information about a free font that has more unicode characters than Arial, please contact me so I can include these information here.</p>
<p>The "Arial" font included in Windows 2000 and later versions should work for all European (West &amp; Central) languages, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew and Arabic.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the font that can be used for some Asiatic langages, if they are installed on your system (those are used by Internet Explorer and Mozilla for
  displaying web pages that are written in these langages).</p>
