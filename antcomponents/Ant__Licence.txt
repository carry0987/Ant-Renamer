These components are those that I use in my projects and that
I do not want to keep in separate packages :
- Components that I made
- CorelButton from http://www.theill.com/delphi.asp
- Some components from JVCL http://jvcl.sourceforge.net/
  (renamed to AntJv***) so I do not have to install this huge package
