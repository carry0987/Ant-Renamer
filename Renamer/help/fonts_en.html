<h1>Font used for special characters</h1>
<p>In the <a href="options_en.html">options window</a> you can select which font has to be used in fields that have to display special characters. This option
  is only available under NT systems (NT4, 2000, XP, Vista, 7 et supérieur) since Unicode is not supported on Windows 95, 98 or ME.</p>
<p>By default, the program tries to use one of these:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Noto Sans, which can be obtained from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/noto" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Google Fonts</a>,</li>
  <li>DejaVu Sans, which can be obtained from <a href="https://github.com/dejavu-fonts/dejavu-fonts" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">DejaVu fonts</a>,</li>
  <li>Arial Unicode MS, which came with older versions of Microsoft Office but was not included in default install (it is called "Universal font" in the installation options).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you only use basic latin characters, you can select any font (e.g. "MS Sans Serif" which is the default for American &amp; West-European systems).
  But if special or foreign character are not displayed correctly (e.g. you see squares instead of the characters), you may need to select a different font.</p>
<p>The "Arial" font included in Windows 2000 and later versions should work for all European (West &amp; Central) languages, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew and Arabic.</p>
<p>For old versions of Windows, here is a list of the font that can be used for some Asiatic langages, if they are installed on your system (those were used by 
  Internet Explorer and Mozilla for displaying web pages that are written in these langages).</p>
<table class="langlist">
  <tr><td>Japanese:</td><td>MS PGothic, MS PMincho, MS Gothic, MS Mincho</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Traditional Chinese:</td><td>MingLiU</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Simplified Chinese:</td><td>SimSun, NSimSun</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Korean:</td><td>GulimChe</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Thai:</td><td>Tahoma</td></tr>
</table>
