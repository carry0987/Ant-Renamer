CONTENTS
========

In this package (antrenamer2_sources.zip) you find two folders:

- Renamer : it contains the program source code, under GPL licence. See licence.txt for more information.
- Common : some files that uses shared code, used in some other programs that I made. Also GPL licence (except one file under MPL). It must be in a "Common" folder sibling to the folder where Ant Renamer source code is located.


INSTALLATION
============

To compile this program you need Delphi 7 with update pack 1. It may work with Delphi 6 (few errors maybe), it may work with "Personal" and "Entreprise" versions (I used "Professional" version). If you have Delphi 7 without update pack 1, some calls to Help file will fail (e.g. Help button in file selection dialog).

You will also need to download a package of components that I made from few components from myself, and some that I extracted from other packages :

https://update.antp.be/comps/antcomponents.zip
check on https://www.antp.be/software/renamer/sources/ if the previous URL is no more valid

In addition of installing the package of these components, you will probably have to install the following components (except if you already have them, of course) :

- Toolbar 2000 + TBX : https://jrsoftware.org/tb2k.php
- VirtualTree 4.4.3 or higher : https://www.jam-software.com/virtual-treeview
- Tnt Delphi Unicode Controls 2.2.7 or higher : https://www.tntware.com/delphicontrols/unicode/
- dEXIF : http://mcguirez.homestead.com/ - can maybe be replaced by https://github.com/cutec-chris/dexif
- TRegExpr : https://regex.sorokin.engineer/

You can also find the version I used on my site, in the case that these components no longer exist or have been updated (if the new version of a component is not compatible with old programs).

You can contact me if you have problems to compile my code, see https://www.antp.be/about/contact/
But do not ask me how to install components or other "basic" questions like that.
If you do not know anything about Delphi, please search first for some tutorials, I do not have time for giving Delphi lessons but only for some hints ;)
